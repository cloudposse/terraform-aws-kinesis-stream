# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  ```hcl
  # Create a standard label resource. See [null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/#terraform-null-label--)
  module "label" {
    source  = "cloudposse/label/null"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version, though usually you want to use the current one
    # version = "x.x.x"

    namespace = "eg"
    name      = "example"
  }

  module "kinesis" {
    source  = "cloudposse/kinesis-stream/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"
